# Bahrain-import
subcategory: Bahrain import of Ship, boats, and Floating structure 

## Problem Statement
This analysis examines Bahrain’s imports of ships, boats, and floating structures from 2020 to 2024 to understand key trade trends, import dependency by country, and pricing dynamics. The goal is to identify major suppliers, detect changes in import value over time, and assess supply concentration risks affecting Bahrain’s maritime sector.

## Approach

* Track yearly import performance by analyzing total import value and quantity from 2020–2024.
* Identify top commodities contributing most to total maritime import value.
* Determine key trading partners by ranking countries based on total import value.
* Calculate dependency ratios to measure how much Bahrain relies on each country for specific commodities.
* Analyze average unit prices to evaluate cost variations across supplier countries.

## Insights & Findings
* Bahrain imported 1,054 different commodities under the Ship, boats, and Floating structure subcategory, with a total import value of BD 32 million and a total quantity of 137K units. 

* Import value peaked in 2020 reaching to 14M BD , then declined sharply in 2021 before recovering gradually through 2024 reaching BD 5.2M. 

* Import quantity followed a similar trend, with a notable rebound in 2024 (72K units) indicating renewed market activity.

* “Other Yachts and Other Vessels for Pleasure” dominated imports with a value of BD 11.2M, accounting for over one-third of total imports for this subcategory.

* The sharp drop between 2020–2021 aligns with global trade disruptions (likely due to the pandemic), while the growth in 2024 signals post-recovery import expansion.

Average import value per unit (BD 30.77K) suggests Bahrain’s maritime imports are largely high-value assets rather than bulk goods.

## Recommendation 
* Diversify import sources for highly concentrated commodities to reduce dependency risk and strengthen supply resilience.

* Monitor yearly trends to anticipate market shifts and adjust procurement strategies based on price and quantity fluctuations.

* Negotiate with top suppliers of high-value imports to secure better trade terms and stable pricing.

* Explore regional trade alternatives to balance cost, reliability, and supply chain risk.
